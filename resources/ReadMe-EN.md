#JLV-handhold: Jetson Lidar and Vision for Robotics and Embodied

We are proud to introduce a handheld device that seamlessly integrates Nvidia Jetson, Livox Mid360, and RealSense camera hardware with an ergonomically designed handle. The device has the following features:

1. **Modular Assembly**: Each component is 3D-printed and reinforced with screws. You can replace the hashboard, radar, and vision camera components at any time, using only one intermediate component.
2. **Compact Design**: While ensuring high space utilization, it provides multiple heat sinks to ensure proper operation. Additional cooling fans can also be added through modular components.
3. **Customizable for Jetson**: The hashboard is designed based on the Orin DK form factor and is compatible with all Jetson computing boards except the Thor, also requiring only one intermediate component.
4. **Built-in Battery Compartment**: The built-in battery compartment allows for instant operation anytime, anywhere, without the need for carrying a separate power supply.
5. **Handheld Grip**: Ergonomically designed grips on both sides of the device evenly distribute force, allowing for even an hour of continuous use without fatigue.
6. **Pre-installed Threaded Holes**: After handheld scanning, the device can be mounted to other hardware platforms using four pre-installed threaded holes, eliminating the need for additional computing power.

On the other hand, because compiling some excellent open source projects on Arm can be challenging, we've also written compilation manuals for some projects so you can find a one-stop solution. Currently supported open source projects include:

* FAST-LIO: [https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO#](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO#)
* FAST-LIVO2: [https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST-LIVO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST-LIVO2)
* Point-LIO: [https://github.com/hku-mars/Point-LIO#](https://github.com/hku-mars/Point-LIO#)
* livox_camera_calib: [https://github.com/hku-mars/livox_camera_calib](https://github.com/hku-mars/livox_camera_calib)
* Yolov11 with GPU: [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)

We will continue to release compilations of more open source projects, so stay tuned!
